# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing failing integration tests in the TasklyCLI component. The tests are failing due to several issues including incorrect flag handling, identifier generation bugs, package manager detection problems, and timeout/signal handling issues.

## Glossary

- **TasklyCLI**: The main command-line interface class for the Taskly application
- **CLI_Flags**: Command-line flags like --help, --version, -h, -v
- **Identifier_Generator**: Method that creates unique identifiers for tasks based on command names
- **Package_Manager_Detector**: Component responsible for detecting and validating package managers
- **Task_Runner**: Component that executes tasks with timeout and signal handling capabilities
- **Integration_Tests**: Tests that verify the complete CLI workflow from argument parsing to task execution

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the CLI, I want help and version flags to work correctly, so that I can get information about the tool without triggering task validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI receives --help flag, THE TasklyCLI SHALL display help information and exit without validating tasks
2. WHEN the CLI receives --version flag, THE TasklyCLI SHALL display version information and exit without validating tasks  
3. WHEN the CLI receives -h flag, THE TasklyCLI SHALL display help information and exit without validating tasks
4. WHEN the CLI receives -v flag, THE TasklyCLI SHALL display version information and exit without validating tasks
5. THE TasklyCLI SHALL NOT attempt to create or validate task configurations when help or version flags are provided

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want task identifiers to be generated correctly from command names, so that tasks can be properly identified and tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generateIdentifier receives a valid command string, THE TasklyCLI SHALL extract the first word and create a clean identifier
2. WHEN generateIdentifier receives an empty command string, THE TasklyCLI SHALL return "task-{index}" format
3. WHEN generateIdentifier receives a command with file paths, THE TasklyCLI SHALL extract only the filename portion
4. WHEN generateIdentifier receives commands with special characters, THE TasklyCLI SHALL remove special characters and keep only alphanumeric characters
5. THE TasklyCLI SHALL always append the index number to the generated identifier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package manager detection to work correctly, so that tasks can be executed with the appropriate package manager.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Package_Manager_Detector SHALL provide isAvailable method to check if a package manager is installed
2. THE Package_Manager_Detector SHALL provide detectFromLockFiles method to detect package manager from lock files
3. WHEN a package manager is not available, THE Package_Manager_Detector SHALL throw appropriate error messages
4. THE Package_Manager_Detector SHALL validate package manager availability before task execution
5. THE Package_Manager_Detector SHALL handle fallback scenarios when preferred package manager is not available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want task execution with timeouts and kill-others-on-fail to work correctly, so that long-running or failing tasks are handled appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task exceeds its timeout limit, THE Task_Runner SHALL terminate the task and return non-zero exit code
2. WHEN kill-others-on-fail is enabled and one task fails, THE Task_Runner SHALL terminate other running tasks
3. WHEN a task is terminated by signal, THE Task_Runner SHALL return non-zero exit code
4. THE Task_Runner SHALL properly handle process cleanup when tasks are terminated
5. THE Task_Runner SHALL provide accurate exit codes that reflect the actual task execution status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling and recovery to work correctly, so that detailed error information is available for debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unexpected errors occur, THE TasklyCLI SHALL display appropriate error messages with bug reporting information
2. WHEN validation errors occur, THE TasklyCLI SHALL provide clear error messages without stack traces
3. WHEN configuration errors occur, THE TasklyCLI SHALL provide specific error messages about the configuration issue
4. THE TasklyCLI SHALL capture and provide detailed error information for failed tasks
5. THE TasklyCLI SHALL handle error recovery scenarios gracefully without crashing
