# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic resolution of ESLint code quality issues in the Taskly codebase. After fixing the ESLint configuration, 345 linting issues remain (168 errors, 177 warnings) that need to be addressed to improve code quality, maintainability, and type safety.

## Glossary

- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript code
- **Nullish Coalescing**: The `??` operator that only returns the right-hand side when the left is null or undefined
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring variables and functions have explicit, correct types instead of `any`
- **Floating Promises**: Promises that are not properly awaited or handled with catch blocks
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to best practices for maintainable, readable, and error-free code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to use nullish coalescing operators instead of logical OR operators, so that the code behaves more predictably with falsy values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code uses logical OR (`||`) for default values, THE Linting_System SHALL suggest nullish coalescing (`??`) instead
2. WHEN nullish coalescing is more appropriate than logical OR, THE Developer SHALL replace `||` with `??`
3. WHEN the replacement is complete, THE ESLint_System SHALL not report prefer-nullish-coalescing warnings
4. WHERE the logical OR is intentionally used for falsy value handling, THE Developer SHALL add ESLint disable comments with justification
5. THE Code_Quality SHALL improve by eliminating unexpected behavior with falsy values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all variables and function parameters to have explicit types instead of `any`, so that the code is type-safe and catches errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable or parameter uses `any` type, THE Developer SHALL specify a proper TypeScript type
2. WHEN function return types are missing, THE Developer SHALL add explicit return type annotations
3. WHEN the type cannot be determined, THE Developer SHALL use appropriate generic types or union types
4. THE TypeScript_Compiler SHALL provide better error detection and IntelliSense support
5. THE ESLint_System SHALL not report no-explicit-any or explicit-function-return-type errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all promises to be properly handled, so that the application doesn't have unhandled promise rejections or silent failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a promise is created or returned, THE Developer SHALL either await it or add proper catch handling
2. WHEN a promise is intentionally not awaited, THE Developer SHALL mark it with void operator or add ESLint disable comment
3. WHEN async functions don't use await, THE Developer SHALL either add await statements or remove async keyword
4. THE Application SHALL not have floating promises that could cause silent failures
5. THE ESLint_System SHALL not report no-floating-promises or require-await errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables and imports to be removed from test files, so that the codebase is clean and doesn't have dead code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are imported but not used in tests, THE Developer SHALL remove the unused imports
2. WHEN variables are declared but not used, THE Developer SHALL either use them or remove them
3. WHERE variables are needed for test setup but not directly used, THE Developer SHALL prefix with underscore
4. THE Test_Files SHALL only contain necessary imports and variables
5. THE ESLint_System SHALL not report no-unused-vars errors in test files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want console statements in CLI code to be properly handled, so that the linting rules are consistent while preserving necessary user output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console statements are necessary for CLI output, THE Developer SHALL add appropriate ESLint disable comments
2. WHEN console statements are for debugging, THE Developer SHALL remove them or replace with proper logging
3. WHERE console output is part of the CLI interface, THE ESLint_Rule SHALL be disabled for those specific lines
4. THE CLI_Functionality SHALL maintain its user-facing output capabilities
5. THE Code_Quality SHALL improve while preserving necessary console output

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want lexical declarations in case blocks to be properly scoped, so that the code follows JavaScript best practices and avoids potential scoping issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lexical declarations exist in case blocks, THE Developer SHALL wrap them in block scope with curly braces
2. WHEN case blocks contain let or const declarations, THE Code_Structure SHALL prevent variable hoisting issues
3. THE Switch_Statements SHALL follow proper scoping rules for lexical declarations
4. THE ESLint_System SHALL not report no-case-declarations errors
5. THE Code_Maintainability SHALL improve through proper variable scoping
