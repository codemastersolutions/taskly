  - Ensure function signatures remain compatible
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 5.4 Test promise handling fixes
  - Verify no unhandled promise rejections occur
  - Test async functionality still works correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Clean up test files
- [ ] 6.1 Remove unused imports from test files
  - Identify and remove imports that are not used
  - Preserve test framework imports (vi, describe, it, expect)
  - _Requirements: 4.1_

- [ ] 6.2 Handle unused variables in tests
  - Remove unused variables or prefix with underscore if needed for setup
  - Clean up dead code in test files
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6.3 Validate test file cleanup
  - Run test suite to ensure all tests still pass
  - Verify test coverage is maintained
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Handle console statements in CLI code
- [ ] 7.1 Add ESLint disable comments for necessary console output
  - Identify console statements that are part of CLI interface
  - Add disable comments for legitimate user-facing output
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [ ] 7.2 Remove debugging console statements
  - Remove console statements used for debugging
  - Replace with proper logging where appropriate
  - _Requirements: 5.2_

- [ ] 7.3 Test CLI functionality preservation
  - Verify CLI output still works as expected
  - Test user-facing commands produce correct output
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 8. Fix lexical declaration scoping issues
- [ ] 8.1 Add block scoping to case statements with lexical declarations
